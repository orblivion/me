Hello,

I set this page up because I thought that Github's interface makes it hard to highlight the interesting stuff on one's main account page (which of course you can find [here](https://github.com/orblivion/)), among all the forks one may have made, perhaps with only a one word change to a documentation string, or perhaps with ultimately no changes at all. Here's a few particularly interesting things I've made.

I should note that I'm (as of this writing) a Python developer by trade, and it's by far my strong suit, but I've fallen in love with Haskell. As such, you'll find a disproportionate amount of Haskell among what I've done in my free time, which has a strong correlation with what ends up on Github. But, I've included some Python.

# Code Samples

## Projects
* **Haskell-Synth** - an attempt to make a Sound/Music synthesizer, in Haskell. When it was in a working state, it would generate a simple measure of electronic music based on hard coded instructions: https://github.com/orblivion/Haskell-Synth
* **Feed Getter** - a purposely simple Podcast downloader written in Haskell: https://github.com/orblivion/feedGetter
* **Fee Fighters - Samurai Python Client** - The initial version of the Python client for the Samurai api created by FeeFighters (now part of Groupon). I created this while working for Alltuition, where we were using FeeFighters to process payments. I should note that this is early in my Python days, and I've improved my style since then: https://github.com/orblivion/samurai-client-python/tree/demo
