Hello,

I set this page up because I thought that Github's interface makes it hard to highlight the interesting stuff on one's main account page (which of course you can find [here](https://github.com/orblivion/)), among all the forks one may have made, perhaps with only a one word change to a documentation string, or perhaps with ultimately no changes at all. Here's a few particularly interesting things I've made.

I should note that while I've been a JavaScript, and Go developer by trade, Python is still my strong suit, and I'm a big fan of Haskell. You may find a disproportionate amount of Haskell among what I've done in my free time, which has a strong correlation with what ends up on Github. But, I've included some Python.

# Code Samples

## Projects
* **Haskell-Synth** - an attempt to make a Sound/Music synthesizer, in Haskell. It generates a simple sequence of electronic music based on hard coded instructions: https://github.com/orblivion/Haskell-Synth
* **Feed Getter** - a purposely simple Podcast downloader written in Haskell: https://github.com/orblivion/feedGetter
* **Fee Fighters - Samurai Python Client** - The initial version of the Python client for the Samurai api created by FeeFighters (now part of Groupon). I created this while working for Alltuition, where we were using FeeFighters to process payments. I should note that this is early in my Python days, and I've improved my style since then: https://github.com/orblivion/samurai-client-python/tree/demo
* **Kiwix package for Sandstorm** - Making it easy to spin up a Wikipedia mirror on your [Sandstorm](sandstorm.io) instance. I neither developed Kiwix itself, nor any part of Sandstorm. However this is still in part a development exercise on top of being a packaging/building exercise. The packaging part was making Kiwix build while it was still in development, helping them debug build errors. The development part was making an uploader that handled large files that ran on Sandstorm, which (at least at the time) didn't support proper Range requests.
